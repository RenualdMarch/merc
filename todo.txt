Current battle issues:
* Flickering in projectiles
* Damage numbers not cleared in highest points
* Redraw bugs during fast movement

Important core stuff

requirement failed: Buying and selling differ

bug: Battle between Set(Set(Player(Byzantine,[SFX]0xff00ffff)), Set())
bug: AI battle sometimes hangs, add more logging?

conquered province economic freeze
add battles with results to UI - end turn newspaper with events of previous turn

Not high priority:
idle animation for soldiers on world map
allow army movement through territory diplomacy
allow hire people from other cultures with some political configurations, now it is possible to hire primary culture warrior anywhere
when hiring soldiers, use actual population
make cultures for castles/walls
check conditional AI logic - unused expression

add more cultures:
Marashy culture as indian?
Vikings culture as scandinavian?
chinese?

Polishing:
issues - balance production and needs multipliers
localization - add parameters order, like %1, %2, %3
soldiers and battles and wars
when armies move they should try move near middle borders

For M8 game polishing and AI

For M9
Consider following:

less or more products - refactor needs
technologies
migration(with churches and mage guilds creation and destruction)
smarter capitalists when creating and expanding factories
terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
add winter weather on maps
corruption and tax evasion
world state unit testing
ability to retreat from battle
army supply
change cursor while drag&drop
Technologies?

Dreams:
terrain season changes
strange wooden bridges placement during map creation(MapObject placement)
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
