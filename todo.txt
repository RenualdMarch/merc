requirement failed: Buying and selling differ

diplomatic info about new events
propose peace and accept if war stalls - write battles to war history
battle pane padding on the left - rework it using save/load
add scroll pane on battles pane
smth very buggy with reputation - its one for all

state dissapeared, war should dissapear also - could not reproduce

Not high priority:
allow hire people from other cultures with some political configurations, now it is possible to hire primary culture warrior anywhere
when hiring soldiers, use actual population(manpower pools?)
idle animation for soldiers on world map
make cultures for castles/walls
check conditional AI logic - unused expression
state rating pane

add more cultures, at least two cultures per race:
Marashy culture as indian?
Vikings culture as scandinavian?
chinese?

localization - add parameters order, like %1, %2, %3
soldiers and battles and wars
when armies move they should try move near middle borders

For M8 game polishing and AI

For M9
Consider following:

less or more products - refactor needs
technologies
smarter capitalists when creating and expanding factories
terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
corruption and tax evasion
world state unit testing
ability to retreat from battle
change cursor while drag&drop

Dreams:
strange wooden bridges placement during map creation(MapObject placement)
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
