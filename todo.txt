Current battle issues:
* Flickering in projectiles
* Damage numbers not cleared in highest points
* Redraw bugs during fast movement

For M6, interface will be a priority, basic politics, factory building
+fix factory saving percentage - it should create reserve for next n days(n = 1 or more)
+cultures - names
+inner politics - parties, government, types of states, party loyalty
+interface - Province population, hapiness, literacy, salary, moneyReserves
+add factory test for output multiplier
+interface - Province enterprises: resources, factories, avg
+add aggregated pop types(all, upper, medium, lower) to pops list
+add wooden bridge with 3 ends
+add menu with state politics and other things
+player controls one faction
+add minimap hide/show button
+next turn button must work
+Market button on province with details
+fill markets pane
+add needs fulfillment to population pane
+pie chart legend must be removed and replaced with scroolable legend
+no more than percentage of people can be capitalists and aristocrats
+Budget interface and implementation
+parties change
+projects - when capitalists or ruler want to expand factory, or hire a soldier, eventual price is unknown.
+projects to have priority in market
+move economics.conf to scala code
+move world creation configs to scala code - hate when there is too many configuration places
+projects creation by capitalists
+projects help by state
+add localization to products
+projects ui
+if there is no supply but demand, price rises faster.
+taxes must go through bureaucrats
bankrupt factories destruction
people have two sources of unhappiness - not fulfilled needs and political stuff
population growth or decline, literacy from scholars
gdp info per province
world state testing
technologies
migration(with churches and mage guilds creation and destruction)
smarter capitalists when creating and expanding factories
strange wooden bridges placement during map creation(MapObject placement)
ability to move map by arrow buttons or moving cursor to the screen borders
next turn button async
less products - refactor needs
More tasks??? - game must be working except for war(no revolutions) and diplomacy

Polishing:
issues - balance production and needs multipliers
localization - add parameters order, like %1, %2, %3

For M7, soldiers and battles and wars
For M8, save/load, game polishing and AI
For M9


Consider following:

terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
add winter weather on maps
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
corruption and tax evasion
