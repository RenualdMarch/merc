Testing and Polishing:
rebalance political parties and views



Not high priority:
Move to JOGL
allow hire people from other cultures with some political configurations, now it is possible to hire primary culture warrior anywhere
add rulers to map
when hiring soldiers, use actual population(manpower pools?)
make cultures for castles/walls
check conditional AI logic - unused expression
idle animation for soldiers on battle
idle animation for soldiers on world map
Other languages
++ Reign of Lords Era ++ Reign of Heroes Era for kings


add more cultures, at least two cultures per race:
Marashy culture as indian?
Vikings culture as scandinavian?

For M8 game polishing and AI

For M9
Consider following:

less or more products - refactor needs
smarter capitalists when creating and expanding factories
terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
corruption and tax evasion
world state unit testing
ability to retreat from battle
change cursor while drag&drop

Dreams:
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
