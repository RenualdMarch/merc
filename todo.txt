when hiring soldiers, use actual population(manpower pools?)
make cultures for castles/walls
check conditional AI logic - unused expression
state rating pane
animate healing

For M8 game polishing and AI

For M9
Consider following:

less or more products - refactor needs
technologies
smarter capitalists when creating and expanding factories
terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
corruption and tax evasion
world state unit testing
ability to retreat from battle
change cursor while drag&drop

Dreams:
strange wooden bridges placement during map creation(MapObject placement)
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
