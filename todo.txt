Current battle issues:
* Flickering in projectiles
* Damage numbers not cleared in highest points
* Redraw bugs during fast movement

+reputation and relations
+after battle is finished logic(change controller, move warriors)
strategy world map AI
add battles with results to UI
separate peace(+badboy)
when 1 and 2 are in alliance and 2 and 3 too, and 1 declares war on 3
add war targets to going war
province claims must be understandable
create claims diplomatically
check conditional AI logic - unused expression
1 season per turn, 4 turns per year
elections
idle animation for soldiers on world map
add state selection screen with offlane word generation
allow hire people from other cultures with some political configurations
when hiring soldiers, use actual population
when showing tooltip, if it is big, find way to show it more when size is too big(recruit soldier tooltip)
end turn newspaper with events of previous turn

add more cultures:
Marashy culture as indian?
Vikings culture as scandinavian?
chinese?

Polishing:
issues - balance production and needs multipliers
localization - add parameters order, like %1, %2, %3
soldiers and battles and wars
tests for balancing warrior types
when armies move they should try move near middle borders

For M8 game polishing and AI

For M9
Consider following:

less or more products - refactor needs
technologies
migration(with churches and mage guilds creation and destruction)
smarter capitalists when creating and expanding factories
terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
add winter weather on maps
corruption and tax evasion
world state unit testing
ability to retreat from battle
army supply
change cursor while drag&drop

Dreams:
terrain season changes
strange wooden bridges placement during map creation(MapObject placement)
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
