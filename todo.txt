Polishing
rebalance political parties and views
allow hire people from other cultures with some political configurations, now it is possible to hire primary culture warrior anywhere
add rulers to map
Move to JOGL
Other languages?


Not high priority:
when hiring soldiers, use actual population(manpower pools?)
make cultures for castles/walls
check conditional AI logic - unused expression
idle animation for soldiers on battle
idle animation for soldiers on world map


add more cultures, at least two cultures per race:
Marashy culture as indian?
Vikings culture as scandinavian?
chinese?

localization - add parameters order, like %1, %2, %3
soldiers and battles and wars
when armies move they should try move near middle borders

For M8 game polishing and AI

For M9
Consider following:

less or more products - refactor needs
technologies
smarter capitalists when creating and expanding factories
terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
corruption and tax evasion
world state unit testing
ability to retreat from battle
change cursor while drag&drop

Dreams:
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
