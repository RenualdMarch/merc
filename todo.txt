fill markets pane
add needs fulfillment to population pane
pie chart legend must be removed and replaced with scroolable legend
no more than percentage of people can be capitalists and aristocrats
Budget interface
Market button on province with details
gdp info per province
migration(with churches creation and destruction)
people have two sources of unhappiness - not fulfilled needs and political stuff
projects - when capitalists or ruler want to expand factory, or hire a soldier, eventual price is unknown.
if there is no supply but demand, price rises faster.
taxes must go through buerocrats
strange wooden bridges placement during map creation(MapObject placement)
add icons to menus
move world creation configs to scala code - hate when there is too many configuration places
ability to hide map(from menu is ok) and move by moving cursor to the screen borders
localization - add parameters order, like %1, %2, %3
next turn button async
More tasks??? - game must be working except for war(no revolutions) and diplomacy

Polishing:
issues - change multipliers to better reflect "reality"

For M7, soldiers and battles and wars
For M8, save/load, game polishing and AI
For M9


Consider following:

terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
add winter weather on maps
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
