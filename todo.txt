Current battle issues:
* Flickering in projectiles
* Damage numbers not cleared in highest points
* Redraw bugs during fast movement

Important core stuff

requirement failed: Buying and selling differ

bug: Battle between Set(Set(Player(Byzantine,[SFX]0xff00ffff)), Set())

battle fixes and polishing
declare war,propose and accept peace diplomacy
save/load

Not high priority:
allow army movement through territory diplomacy
allow hire people from other cultures with some political configurations, now it is possible to hire primary culture warrior anywhere
when hiring soldiers, use actual population
idle animation for soldiers on world map
make cultures for castles/walls
check conditional AI logic - unused expression

add more cultures, at least two cultures per race:
Marashy culture as indian?
Vikings culture as scandinavian?
chinese?

Polishing:
issues - balance production and needs multipliers
localization - add parameters order, like %1, %2, %3
soldiers and battles and wars
when armies move they should try move near middle borders

For M8 game polishing and AI

For M9
Consider following:

less or more products - refactor needs
technologies
smarter capitalists when creating and expanding factories
terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
corruption and tax evasion
world state unit testing
ability to retreat from battle
change cursor while drag&drop

Dreams:
strange wooden bridges placement during map creation(MapObject placement)
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
