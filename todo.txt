* Damage numbers not cleared in highest points
* Redraw bugs during fast movement

armies movement
armies economic part
next turn button async, messages framework
remove ai from player
battles
check conditional AI logic - unused expression
1 season per turn, 4 turns per year
elections
idle animation for soldiers on world map
Polishing:
issues - balance production and needs multipliers
localization - add parameters order, like %1, %2, %3
soldiers and battles and wars


For M8 game polishing and AI
For M9

Consider following:

less products - refactor needs
technologies
migration(with churches and mage guilds creation and destruction)
smarter capitalists when creating and expanding factories
terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
add winter weather on maps
corruption and tax evasion
world state unit testing
legendary warriors - leaders
ability to retreat from battle

Dreams:

strange wooden bridges placement during map creation(MapObject placement)
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
