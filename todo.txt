requirement failed: Buying and selling differ

peaceful neighbours bug
state hates itself(because of claims?)
racial hatred - give alignment to cultures
friendship treaty - prevents creating claims and declaring wars, but can join wars with allies
friendship treaty - drops all claims
drop claim button
after vassalization claims against overlord are dropped
alliance claims against each other are dropped and not created any more
ask allies to join your war
add rulers to map
add parliament to government pane on diplomacy pane

totally rework AI diplomacy with new features

Map generation scenarios:
1) Random, as now
2) One state per culture
3) One province per state for culture


Polishing
rebalance political parties and views

Not high priority:
allow hire people from other cultures with some political configurations, now it is possible to hire primary culture warrior anywhere
when hiring soldiers, use actual population(manpower pools?)
make cultures for castles/walls
check conditional AI logic - unused expression
state rating pane
animate healing
idle animation for soldiers on battle
idle animation for soldiers on world map
think about interesting events, look at stellaris


add more cultures, at least two cultures per race:
Marashy culture as indian?
Vikings culture as scandinavian?
chinese?
+_Forestfolk

Elves
- deep elves \ Deep Elves ???
- more dark elves \ Rashy - darkelves

Orcs
- more northern orcs \ _Northern Orcs

Undead
???

Dwarfs
???

+Saurian
+Drakes
+Trolls


+Aquana
+Minotaurs
+Frozen
+Nagas
+Merfolks

Polishing:
issues - balance production and needs multipliers
localization - add parameters order, like %1, %2, %3
soldiers and battles and wars
when armies move they should try move near middle borders

For M8 game polishing and AI

For M9
Consider following:

less or more products - refactor needs
technologies
smarter capitalists when creating and expanding factories
terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
corruption and tax evasion
world state unit testing
ability to retreat from battle
change cursor while drag&drop

Dreams:
strange wooden bridges placement during map creation(MapObject placement)
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
