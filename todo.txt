Current battle issues:
* Flickering in projectiles
* Damage numbers not cleared in highest points
* Redraw bugs during fast movement

diplomacy
next turn button async, messages framework
remove ai from player in battles
battles
check conditional AI logic - unused expression
1 season per turn, 4 turns per year
elections
idle animation for soldiers on world map
add state selection screen with offlane word generation
allow hire people from other cultures with some political configurations
when hiring soldiers, use actual population
when showing tooltip, if it is big, find way to show it more when size is too big(recruit soldier tooltip)
terrain season changes
add more cultures:
luz culture as spain
Marashy culture as indian
Emperor's Guard culture as Japanese

Polishing:
issues - balance production and needs multipliers
localization - add parameters order, like %1, %2, %3
soldiers and battles and wars
tests for balancing warrior types
when armies move they should try move near middle borders



For M8 game polishing and AI

For M9
Consider following:

less or more products - refactor needs
technologies
migration(with churches and mage guilds creation and destruction)
smarter capitalists when creating and expanding factories
terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
add winter weather on maps
corruption and tax evasion
world state unit testing
ability to retreat from battle
army supply
change cursor while drag&drop

Dreams:

strange wooden bridges placement during map creation(MapObject placement)
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
