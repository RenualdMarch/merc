* Flickering in projectiles
* Damage numbers not cleared in highest points
* Redraw bugs during fast movement

For M6, interface will be a priority, basic politics, factory building
+fix factory saving percentage - it should create reserve for next n days(n = 1 or more)
+cultures - names
+inner politics - parties, government, types of states, party loyalty
+interface - Province population, hapiness, literacy, salary, moneyReserves
+add factory test for output multiplier
+interface - Province enterprises: resources, factories, avg
+add aggregated pop types(all, upper, medium, lower) to pops list
+add wooden bridge with 3 ends
add menu with state politics and other things
player controls one faction, enemy province view
add minimap hide/show button
add needs fulfillment to population pane
pie chart legend must be removed and replaced with scroolable legend
no more than percentage of people can be capitalists and aristocrats
add churches to provinces
Budget interface
Market button on province with details
gdp info per province
migration(with churches creation and destruction)
people have two sources of unhappiness - not fulfilled needs and political stuff
projects - when capitalists or ruler want to expand factory, or hire a soldier, eventual price is unknown.
if there is no supply but demand, price rises faster.
taxes must go through buerocrats
strange wooden bridges placement
ability to hide map(from menu is ok) and move by moving cursor to the screen borders
check  historical records - last for factories and first for population, is it correct? add aggregated records
localization - add parameters order, like %1, %2, %3
More tasks??? - game must be working except for war(no revolutions) and diplomacy

Polishing:
issues - change multipliers to better reflect "reality"

For M7, soldiers and battles and wars
For M8, save/load, game polishing and AI
For M9


Consider following:

terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
add winter weather on maps
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
