Current battle issues:
* Flickering in projectiles
* Damage numbers not cleared in highest points
* Redraw bugs during fast movement

For M6, interface will be a priority, basic politics, factory building

+ability to move map by arrow buttons
next turn button async, messages framework
1 season per turn, 4 turns per year

Polishing:
issues - balance production and needs multipliers
localization - add parameters order, like %1, %2, %3

For M7, soldiers and battles and wars
For M8, save/load, game polishing and AI
For M9


Consider following:

less products - refactor needs
technologies
migration(with churches and mage guilds creation and destruction)
smarter capitalists when creating and expanding factories
terrain additives specifically for given terrain types
add winter weather on maps
corruption and tax evasion
world state unit testing

Dreams:

strange wooden bridges placement during map creation(MapObject placement)
water animation
windmill animation
Let map reflect actual province factories and resources
