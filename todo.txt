Consider following:

terrain additives specifically for given terrain types

+Add rivers
Add roads between cities with bridges across seas
Make cities of different size instead of lone castles
Bug with lone sand
Performance optimization for huge maps
Add different images for same terrain type 
Add some beauty to map - e.g fields with grain and other cool things
Complete world map UI without soldiers

For M6, interface will be a priority, basic politics, factory building
For M7, soldiers and battles and wars
For M8, save/load, game polishing and AI
For M9
